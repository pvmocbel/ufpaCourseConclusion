A new definition of noise margin and the concept of probability of outage are introduced, which allow for an easier formulation of the problems of joint margin and spectra optimization of the lines taking into account their stabilities. The solutions to the highly-coupled optimization problems are simplified using noise margins instead of signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio margins. The presented algorithms provide up to 100% improvements in the data-rates or a reduction in the probability of outage by an order of magnitude, thus improving the stability of the lines at high data rates.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents efficient multiuser margin optimization algorithms suitable for multicarrier digital subscriber line (DSL) systems using Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM). The favorable monotonicity and fairness properties of multiuser margin are employed to formulate a box-constrained nonlinear least squares (NLSQ) problem for multiuser margin maximization, which is efficiently solved by using a scaled-gradient trust-region approach with Broyden Jacobian update. Based on this NLSQ formulation, a multiuser harmonized margin (MHM) optimization algorithm for resource allocation is developed. A Newton-Raphson method is also developed for fast margin estimation and used within the MHM. The MHM algorithm converges efficiently to a solution for the best common equal margin to all users, while explicitly guaranteeing their target rate requirements. (This is the reason for the term harmonized.) Furthermore, its predominantly distributed structure can be implemented in DSL/DSM scenarios with only Level 1 coordination. Simulation results of various cases verify the convergence to the unique optimal solution within 5-10 iterations},

	Abstract = {Dynamic spectrum management (DSM) is an important technique for mitigating crosstalk noise in multi-user digital subscriber line (DSL) environments. Until now, most of the proposed algorithms for DSM have been designed solely for the purpose of bitrate maximization. These algorithms assume a fixed maximum total power and neglect the energy consumption in DSL modems. However, since recently there is a strong interest in the DSL field to reduce energy consumption as shown, e.g., by the European Commissionspsila code of conduct on energy consumption of broadband equipment. In contrast to traditional DSM, this paper will show how DSM can be used for minimizing the energy consumption. We will formulate a global optimization problem for energy minimization and discuss several of its peculiarities compared to the current DSM problems. Furthermore, we derive an iterative, dual-based and semi-distributed algorithm for its local solution, which we call energy-efficient spectrum balancing (EESB). The performance of the algorithm is evaluated through simulations, which show similar results to optimal schemes. In addition, EESB achieves substantial energy savings that can be exploited by adapting the transmit powers to userspsila bitrate demand.},
