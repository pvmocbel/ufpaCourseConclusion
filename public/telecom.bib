The cyclostationarity-based features used by these algorithms are robust with respect to timing, phase, and frequency offsets, and phase noise.

abstract={Cognitive radio systems require often a capability to recognize used waveforms either for communications or detection purposes. This is a shared problem with many military signal analysis systems. In this paper we present a study of multi-class signal classification based on automatic modulation recognition through Support Vectrom Machines (SVM). We have implement a simulated model of an SVM signal classifier trained to recognize seven distinct modulation schemes; five digital (BPSK, QPSK, GMSK, 16-QAM and 64QAM) and two analog ones (FM and AM). The signals are generated using realistic carrier frequency, sampling frequency and symbol rate values, and pulse-shaping filters types. We also report on our on-going experimental work by using software defined radios (SDR) to implement this as a part of our cognitive radio network testbed. The results show that overall performance of classifier is very good; the trained SVM correctly classifies signals with 85-98% probability in its current state of development.},

abstract={Automatic modulation classification is used to identify automatically the modulation type of an incoming signal with limited or no prior knowledge to it. Various classifier systems have been developed to solve this problem. However, for certain types of modulations such as 16 QAM and 64 QAM, the classification performance under noisy condition still needs to be improved. In this paper, we propose a new AMC scheme by combining genetic programing (GP) with support vector machine (SVM) for the classification of 16 QAM and 64 QAM signals. The benchmark result shows that SVM assisted GP can produce better accuracy than some other existing methods.},

abstract={The estimation of the spectrum usage from the point of view of number of users and modulation types is addressed in this paper. The techniques used here are based on Support Vector Machines (SVM). SVMs are machine learning strategies which use a robust cost function alternative to the widely used Least Squares function and that apply a regularization which provides control of the complexity of the resulting estimators. As a result, estimators are robust against interferences and nongaussian noise and present excellent generalization properties where the number of data available for the estimation is small. The structure presented here has a feature extraction part that, instead of using an FFT approach, uses the SVM criterion for spectrum estimation, feature extraction and modulation classification.},

abstract={Cognitive radio technology increases spectrum utilization by enabling secondary users to opportunistically use the spectrum when primary users are inactive. Secondary users use spectrum sensing to detect the presence of primary users in order to avoid causing harmful interference. To the best of our knowledge, all existing spectrum sensing methods are essentially physical spectrum sensing, in the sense that nodes physically tune their radio to each frequency band to sense the spectrum. In this paper, we propose a complementary approach, virtual spectrum sensing, which achieves the same goal but only senses a very small portion of the spectrum. This approach enables a Distributed Information SHaring (DISH) mechanism, where neighboring users cooperatively share spectrum usage information (obtained from virtual spectrum sensing) with users who need it in decision making. This paper presents an application of DISH to cognitive radio networks. We provide a Cognitive DISH framework which describes guidelines for cognitive radio protocol design based on virtual spectrum sensing and DISH. Under this framework, we design a protocol, VISH-I, and evaluate its performance via simulations. As the number of secondary users increases, the interference caused to primary users results in only 5% performance degradation, but the overall channel utilization is increased by 87-203%. In addition, to demonstrate that virtual sensing is complementary to physical sensing, we design a hybrid spectrum sensing protocol, VISH-II, which improves performance by 7-50% over VISH-I.},

abstract={In currently cooperative spectrum sensing, each secondary user requires some information in order to achieve the vacant spectrum sensing. Energy detection is commonly used in local spectrum sensing. However, performance of cooperative spectrum sensing based on energy detection is damaged due to the noise uncertainty in realistic environment. In this paper, blind source separation algorithm is introduced to spectrum sensing for cognitive radio. Therefore local blind spectrum sensing is proposed, which is based on source separation. Blind spectrum sensing does not require any information of the source signal and the channel. So it can accomplish local spectrum sensing on total blind. Further, because of the advantage of blind spectrum sensing, we can exploit it to cooperative spectrum sensing. And cooperative spectrum sensing based on blind source separation is given, which can improve reliability of cooperative spectrum sensing. Numerical analysis and computer simulation suggest that proposed algorithm achieves the vacant spectrum sensing and overcomes effect of noise uncertainty to statistical decision. Moreover, blind spectrum sensing should be better than energy detection for correlated signals.},

Closed-form expressions of overall detection probability for the non-cooperative spectrum sensing, the AF-CSS and the DF-CSS schemes are derived over Rayleigh fading channels to show the effect of user cooperation on the detection performance. Besides, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative schemes, which shows the increase of detection probability by user cooperation for cognitive radio networks, further confirming the advantage of the AF-CSS and the DF-CSS schemes over the traditional non-cooperative spectrum sensing.},

abstract={Most critical component of the cognitive radio paradigm is spectrum sensing and accordingly, detection of primary users. Recently proposed cooperative spectrum sensing methods do not consider errors occurring during the transmission of local cognitive radio decisions to the cognitive base station. However, perfect communication is clearly not the case in realistic cooperative spectrum sensing scenarios and might lead to misleading performance result interpretations. In this paper, we extend the simple cooperative spectrum sensing communication model to admit transmission imperfections. Specifically, we consider the case where the local hard cognitive radio decisions that are based on any local detection scheme are corrupted by additive noise during transmission from cognitive radios to cognitive base station. Utilizing this extended cooperative spectrum sensing model, we present the complex optimal and a practical and effective suboptimal detector that is capable of operating with any local cognitive radio detection scheme: Two-step detector. We present simulation results investigating the performance of the proposed detectors and the effect of parameters of interest such as number of cognitive radios and signal to noise ratio. Moreover, we provide comparisons between non-cooperative and cooperative spectrum sensing performances revealing some cases where non-cooperative scheme is more effective.},

abstract={The first challenge of cognitive radio is spectrum sensing. Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) has the advantage of better accuracy over non-cooperative schemes. One of the critical problems in CSS is the delay between sensing and decision. Wideband spectrum sensing forms another challenge due to its complexity and large dynamic range requirements. To solve these problems, we propose new co-operative spectrum sensing techniques inspired by multiple access methods: Time-division (TD), frequency-division (FD), staggered frequency-division (SFD), frequency-hopping (FH), irregular subband (IS), and staggered irregular subband (SIS) cooperative spectrum sensing. Co-operative users are first divided into groups. In TD-CSS, those groups in turn detect the presence of primary users to reduce delay. To tackle the difficulties of wideband spectrum sensing, FD-CSS assigns different groups to different spectrum bands. SFD-CSS can solve time delay and wideband spectrum sensing issues at the same time by making each group sequentially detect different frequency in different order. FH-CSS performs better than FD-CSS if the channel information is unknown. Finally, asymmetric band access concepts can be applied to CSS to allow different groups focus on frequency bands with irregular subband bandwidth using IS-CSS or SIS-CSS.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a method based on support vector machines {(SVMs)} for recognizing digital modulation signals in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise. As a powerful method for pattern recognition, {SVMs} with radial basis function {(RBF)} kernels are incorporated to form the multi-class recognition system which employs the conventional features of each signal obtained from its amplitude, frequency, and phase information. Computer simulations of different types of band-limited digitally modulated signals corrupted by Gaussian white noise have been carried out to measure the performance of the classification method. The simulation results that the accuracy rate of this method is at lest 85.67\% show that the recognition method based on {SVMs} is effective. And the performance of the automatic recognition method is very satisfactory with high overall success rates even in a low signal to noise ratio {(SNR)} environment},
